// Your challenge is to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

// You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

// Your users should be able to:

//     See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
//     See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
//     Bonus: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle
